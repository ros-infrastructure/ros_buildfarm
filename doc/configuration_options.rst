Configuration options
=====================

The ROS build farm configuration has a similar structure than the rosdistro
specification (see `REP 143 <http://www.ros.org/reps/rep-0143.html>`_ for
details).

The configuration for the official ROS build farm configuration acts as an
example and can be found on
`GitHub (ros-infrastructure/ros_buildfarm_config) <https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/ros_buildfarm_config>`_.


Entry point yaml
----------------

This yaml file acts as the entry point to the ROS build farm configuration.
Most script require to pass the URL to this file as an argument.

The file format is specified by the following information:

* ``type: buildfarm`` identifies the yaml file as the entry point for the ROS
  build farm configuration.
* ``version: 1`` specifies the specification version of the file.

The following options are valid in version ``1``:

* ``distributions``: a dictionary mapping lowercase ROS distribution names to
  the following build files.
  The key "*default*" for a build file is hidden when being used to generate
  view / job prefixes.

  * ``release_builds``: a dictionary of release build files indexed by their
    name.
  * ``source_builds``: a dictionary of source build files indexed by their
    name.
  * ``doc_builds``: a dictionary of doc build files indexed by their name.

  All build file references can be either relative path or absolute URLs.

  * ``notification_emails``: a list of email addresses for notification about
    ROS distribution specific administrative jobs.

* ``git_ssh_credential_id``: the ID of the credential entry managed on the
  Jenkins master which is used to clone sources using Git over SSH.
  This credential id is set in the buildfarm_deployment.

* ``jenkins_url``: the URL of the Jenkins master.

* ``notification_emails``: a list of email addresses for notification about
  ROS distribution agnostic administrative jobs.

* ``prerequisites``: a dictionary containing information about repositories
  which contain the necessary tools to run the ROS build farm.
  Currently the configuration only supports Debian repositories:

  * ``debian_repositories``: a list of URLs to Debian repositories.
  * ``debian_repository_keys``: a list of PGP keys each as a multi line string.
    The order of the keys must match the repository URLs.

* ``rosdistro_index_url``: the URL to the rosdistro index yaml file.
* ``status_page_repositories``: a dictionary mapping names to a list of
  repository URLs.
  For each entry in the dictionary a
  `repos-status-page <jobs/miscellaneous_jobs#status-pages.rst>`_ is being
  generated.


Generic options in build files
------------------------------

A set of options which can be used in any build file.

* ``build_environment_variables``: a dictionary containing environment
  variables which will be inserted into binarydeb build containers before
  package dependencies are installed using Dockerfile ``ENV`` directives.
  Note that yaml will turn bare words like ``yes`` into boolean values so it
  is recommended to quote values to avoid interpretation.

* ``project_authorization_xml``: an XML blob which will be nested within a
  ``<hudson.security.AuthorizationMatrixProperty>`` in job builds.
  This property is defined for all build files but as of `#737`_ is only
  implemented for **CI jobs**.

  .. _#737: https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/ros_buildfarm/pull/737

* ``repositories``: additional repositories to fetch packages from.

  * ``keys``: a list of PGP keys each as a multi line string.
    The order of the keys must match the repository URLs.
  * ``urls``: a list of URLs to repositories.

* ``tag_whitelist``: a list of tags to whitelist to identify which rosdistro
  distribution files this build file should operate on.
* ``tag_blacklist``: a list of tags to blacklist to identify which rosdistro
  distribution files this build file should not operate on.

* ``targets``: a nested dictionary of targets for which packages are built.
  The first level key contains the OS name.
  The second level key contains the OS code name.
  The third level key contains the CPU architecture.
  The third level value is always empty.
  The first level key "_config" is reserved for specifying target specific
  information.

  The OS names and OS code names specified must be listed as a
  *release platform* in the corresponding rosdistro distribution file.

  A doc build file of **rosdoc_lite**, **released_manifest** or **make_target**
  documentation type can only be built for a single target and thus it must not
  specificy more than one.

  A doc build file of **docker_build** documentation type is built for the
  platform the associated docker image is based on, therefore no targets can
  be specified.

Description of common options
-----------------------------

* **Jenkins job priorities**: a lower number means a higher priority.

  If no value is provided the generated job will not have specific priority.
  Then you should specify them using *JobGroups* through the Jenkins user
  interface.

  The job priorities of the administrative jobs are hard coded:

  * ``rosdistro-cache`` jobs: 10
  * ``check_agents`` job: 20
  * ``dashboard`` job: 20
  * ``*-status-page`` jobs: 20
  * ``reconfigure-jobs`` jobs: 30
  * ``*-trigger-jobs`` jobs: 40

  It is highly recommended to only use lower priorities for the actual jobs
  (aka higher numbers).

* **Jenkins job timeouts**: the number of minutes after which a job should be
  aborted.

* **Jenkins job label**: the label expression to restrict the execution of a
  job to a specific computer or group of machines.

* **Notification emails**: the notification about repository / package specific
  job statuses can be send to:

  * a list of statically configure email addresses.
  * a list of maintainer email addresses extracted from the package manifests
    being processed.
  * a list of developer email addresses extracted from version control system.

* **Package / repository white- / blacklisting**: if no whitelist is specified
  all existing items are being used.
  The blacklist is applied after the whitelist which means if an item is in
  both lists it is being *excluded*.

* **Skip ignored packages / repositories**: by default jobs are still being
  generated for blacklisted (or not whitelisted) items but these jobs are
  disabled.
  To avoid generating these jobs to be generated set this flag to ``true``.

* **Credential ID**: the ID of the credential entry managed on the Jenkins
  master which is commonly used to upload artifacts to another host.
  This credential id is set in the buildfarm_deployment.

Specific options in CI build files
----------------------------------

This yaml file defines the configuration for *CI* jobs.

The file format is specified by the following information:

* ``type: ci-build`` identifies the yaml file as a *CI build file*.
* ``version: 1`` specifies the specification version of the file.

The following options are valid in version ``1`` (beside the generic options):

* ``build_tool``: the build tool to use.
  The following are valid values:

  * ``catkin_make_isolated``
  * ``colcon`` (default)

* ``build_tool_args``: arbitrary arguments passed to the build tool.

* ``install_packages``: a list of packages which should be installed by default
  before any of the dependencies necessary to build the packages in the
  workspace.
  Since not all packages in the workspace are necessarily ROS packages, rosdep
  may be unable to detect and install the prerequisites for those packages, so
  those prerequisite packages may need to be listed here.

* ``jenkins_job_priority``: the job priority of *CI* jobs.

* ``jenkins_job_schedule``: the schedule on which to run the nightly *CI* job.
  For example, to run the nightly build at 11 PM each night, a value of
  ``0 23 * * *`` may be used.

* ``jenkins_job_timeout``: the job timeout for *CI* jobs.

* ``jenkins_job_upstream_triggers``: names of other CI jobs which, when
  built with a stable or unstable result, should trigger this job to be built.

* ``package_selection_args``: package selection arguments passed to ``colcon``
  to specify which packages should be built and tested.
  Note that ``colcon`` is always used to select packages even when
  ``build_tool`` specifies something other else.

* ``repos_files``: the list of ``.repos`` files to use by default when creating
  a workspace to build.

* ``repository_names``: the names of repositories in the rosdistro to be
  checkout into the workspace with their branch specified in the ``source``
  entry.

* ``show_images``: a dictionary of lists, where the key is the title of a group
  of image artifacts to display and the list contains workspace-relative paths
  to images generated by each build which should be displayed on the build's
  summary page.
  These images will automatically be added to the artifacts for each build.

* ``show_plots``: a dictionary of lists, where the key is the title of the
  plot group and the list contains plot definitions comprised of:

  * ``title``: the title of the plot.
  * ``y_axis_label``: (optional) a label for the y-axis.
  * ``master_csv_name``: the name of the CSV file in which to aggregate the
    results on the Jenkins master.
    It must be unique among all plot instances on the same Jenkins master.
  * ``style``: the type of plot used to display the data.
    Supported values: area, bar, bar3d, line, lineSimple, line3d, stackedArea,
    stackedBar, stackedBar3d, waterfall
  * ``y_axis_exclude_zero``: a boolean flag which indicates when to exclude an
    implicit zero value from the y-axis.
  * ``y_axis_minimum``: Minimum y-axis value.
  * ``y_axis_maximum``: Maximum y-axis value.
  * ``num_builds``: Number of builds back to show on this plot (default: ``0``
    which means all builds).
  * ``data_series``: a list of data series definitions comprised of:

    * ``data_file``: a path pattern relative to the workspace root to a file
      containing the data.
    * ``data_type``: the type of file to which ``data_file`` refers.
      Supported values: csv, xml, properties
    * ``selection_flag``: strategy used to identify which data from the
      ``data_file`` should be extracted and plotted.
      Supported values: OFF, INCLUDE_BY_STRING, EXCLUDE_BY_STRING,
      INCLUDE_BY_COLUMN, EXCLUDE_BY_COLUMN
    * ``selection_value``: specific criteria used for selection.
      The meaning of this value differs based on ``selection_flag``.
      For example, when INCLUDE_BY_COLUMN is used, this value should specify
      which column number to include (1-indexed).
      For \*_BY_STRING, the, this value should specify the column name.
      For EXCLUDE\_\*, the logic is inverted and all discovered columns EXCEPT
      those matching this value are included.
    * ``url``: Hyperlink URL to redirect when a point is clicked.

* ``skip_rosdep_keys``: a list of rosdep keys which should be ignored when
  rosdep is invoked to resolve package dependencies.

* ``test_branch``: branch to attempt to checkout and merge in each repository
  before running the job.

* ``underlay_from_ci_jobs``: names of other CI jobs which should be used
  as an underlay to this job.
